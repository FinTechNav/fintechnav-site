            <h3>My Life Behind the Drums</h3>
            <p>When I'm not deep in the world of financial technology, you'll likely find me behind a drum kit. Music has been a constant thread throughout my life, starting with my father's influence as a guitarist.</p>
            <p>I actually began my musical journey on guitar, then moved to bass, before finally finding my true home behind the drums. There's something about the rhythm and energy of drumming that provides the perfect counterbalance to the strategic thinking of my day job.</p>
            <p>Over the years in Atlanta, I've been fortunate to play with several bands:</p>
            <p>The Joy Kills was probably the highlight of my musical journey - we toured nationally, released several albums, built a consistent local following, and even opened for Cage The Elephant at their album release show. Not too shabby!</p>
            <p>I've also kept time for bands like Campaign, Sonic Speculum, Maudlin Ash, and Second Glance.</p>

            <h3>From First Sip to Wine Passion</h3>
            <p>In 2006, I was in Las Vegas attending a conference when I had the very fortunate occasion at one of our business dinners to taste a 1982 Chateau Margaux.</p>
            <p>Since that night, you could say I have been hooked on fine wine.</p>
            <p>What started as appreciation quickly grew into a full-blown passion. In 2022, I even received my WSET Level 1 Award in wines, which is just the beginning of my formal wine education.</p>
            <p>My wife Dio and I have gotten involved with the Atlanta High Museum's Wine Auction at the Benefactor level, and we've become investors in wineries in both Tuscany and Napa. Along the way, we've traveled the country and the world seeking out amazing wine, food, and people.</p>
            <p>For a deeper dive into my wine adventures, check out my dedicated blog at <a href="https://heavypourwine.com" target="_blank">Heavy Pour Wine</a>, where I document my ongoing journey into this endlessly enjoyable, educational, and inspirational world.</p>
