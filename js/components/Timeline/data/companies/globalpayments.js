    "After Abanco was acquired by Cynergy Data, I declined their offer and instead joined Global Payments â€” where my mentor from Union Camp and GO Software was now working. Our mission was to build a payment gateway from the ground up. Interestingly, we used the same technology stack we'd used at Abanco. With Global Payments headquartered in Atlanta, this was a welcome return to working in my home city.",
