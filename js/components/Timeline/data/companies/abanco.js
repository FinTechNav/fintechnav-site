    'After GO Software was purchased by VeriFone and I felt the culture change wasn\'t for me, I followed a sales colleague I had worked closely with at GO Software to Abanco:',
  highlights: [
    'Increased platform availability from two 9\'s to five 9\'s through process improvement and monitoring tools',
    'Worked closely with Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, Training, and IT teams',
    'Drove process changes that improved Payment Gateway stability and reliability',
    'Managed a direct report responsible for developer support and technical escalations',
  ],
  conclusion:
    'This was also when I made my big move from Savannah to Atlanta - much easier to fly direct from Atlanta to Chicago than from Savannah! During my time there, Abanco was acquired by Cynergy Data, and I chose to move on to a new opportunity rather than continuing with the acquiring company.',
