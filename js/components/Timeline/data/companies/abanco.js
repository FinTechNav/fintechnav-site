    "After GO Software was purchased by VeriFone and I felt the culture change wasn't for me, I followed a sales colleague I had worked closely with at GO Software to Abanco:",
  highlights: [
    "Increased platform availability from two 9's to five 9's through process improvement and monitoring tools",
    'Worked closely with Sales, Marketing, Customer Support, Training, and IT teams',
    'Drove process changes that improved Payment Gateway stability and reliability',
    'Managed a direct report responsible for developer support and technical escalations',
  ],
  conclusion:
    'This was my first hybrid position - I worked from home in Atlanta while flying to Chicago (where the company was headquartered) regularly, spending roughly half my time between the two locations. This is where I got comfortable with work from home and hybrid arrangements well before the pandemic forced this upon everyone. During my time there, Abanco was acquired by Cynergy Data, and I chose to move on to a new opportunity rather than continuing with the acquiring company.',
