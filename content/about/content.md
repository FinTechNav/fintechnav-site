  ### The Short:


  I'm a product management executive with a focus on FinTech. For those whose lives don't happen to intersect with that particular corner of the world, that means I work in financial technology. I help to improve and automate traditional forms of payments for both businesses and consumers. Think about the magic of credit cards and such that most folks take for granted without ever having to know how all that stuff actually works.


  I'm one of the people who has to know how that stuff actually works!


  My wife Dio and I have been married since 2014. We live in Atlanta with two rescue dogs (Kirby and Matty), and when I'm not thinking about or dealing with FinTech, I am focused on my three main passions in life: fine wines, traveling, and playing the drums.

  The Long:▼


  I was born in the beautiful, historic coastal city of Savannah, Georgia in 1974. Both of my parents are retired now, but when I was growing up, one of my parents was a computer store owner and accounting professor who also plays the guitar. The other taught English. I suppose it's no surprise that I grew up to become a computer guy that's good with numbers and composition, who also enjoys playing heavy rock music!


  I began my technology career before I'd even left college — as a tech support intern on what was supposed to be a three-month internship at Union Camp Corporation. However, once that internship had run its course, the company offered me a full-time position. Once I'd accepted, they paid for my tuition and books, as well. I stayed with that firm for six years, all the while completing my degree. I'm thrilled to say I graduated from Savannah State University with a BA In Business, and no student debt!


  My transition into FinTech began with GO Software in Savannah in 1999, where I worked in payment processing for six years. In 2005, I moved to Atlanta and continued building my career in FinTech with various companies — both large and small. My specialty in that field is delivering innovative and highly available financial products for retailers and merchants of all shapes and sizes.

  Growing up in Savannah and my education:▼


  I attended Savannah Country Day School from pre-school through 7th grade. My father was a guitarist in high school and college, so I learned guitar at an early age. In 8th grade, I moved to public school at Derenne Middle School.


  When my mom remarried, we moved to Baxley, GA because of my stepdad's job as a Hospital Administrator. I attended Appling County Comprehensive High School for 9th-12th grades, where I was involved in various school music projects as well as my own bands — first as a guitarist, then moved to bass and finally to drums. I also played bass drum in marching band.


  I worked at a fast food restaurant part-time to pay for gas and car insurance, and moved back to Savannah to attend Armstrong State College, where I started a Computer Science degree. During this time, I started a hard rock band (playing drums) and met my mentor at Union Camp Corporation, where I was offered a summer internship doing video editing and then computer tech support.


  My mentor later convinced me to switch degree paths and colleges. I left Armstrong and went to Savannah State College, where I earned a BA in Business - Management Information Systems.
