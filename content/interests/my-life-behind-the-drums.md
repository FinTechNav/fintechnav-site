title: My Life Behind the Drums
content: >-
  When I'm not deep in the world of financial technology, you'll likely find me
  behind a drum kit. Music has been a constant thread throughout my life,
  starting with my father's influence as a guitarist.


  I actually began my musical journey on guitar, then moved to bass, before finally finding my true home behind the drums. There's something about the rhythm and energy of drumming that provides the perfect counterbalance to the strategic thinking of my day job.


  Over the years, I've been fortunate to play with several bands in both Savannah and Atlanta:


  **In Savannah:** I played drums in Capital A, a hard rock band. We played many local and regional shows and festivals, released several albums and received regular radio play locally.


  **In Atlanta:** I've kept time for bands like Second Glance, Maudlin Ash, Campaign, and Sonic Speculum. The Joy Kills was probably the highlight of my musical journey - we toured nationally, released several albums, built a consistent local following, and even opened for Cage The Elephant at their album release show. Not too shabby!
